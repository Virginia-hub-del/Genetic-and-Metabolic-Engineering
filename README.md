# Genetic-and-Metabolic-Engineering
This project focuses on genetic and metabolic engineering to optimize biological systems using Flux Balance Analysis (FBA). With E. coli as a model, it explores how the bacterium adapts its metabolism under varying oxygen levels and carbon sources, with applications in synthetic biology and biomolecule production.
