**Objective**: Evaluate the maximum growth rate of *E. coli* under different environmental conditions, comparing aerobic and anaerobic growth using glucose and succinate as carbon sources.  
**Background**: This analysis highlights metabolic adaptations of *E. coli* in response to varying oxygen availability, providing key insights for metabolic engineering and synthetic biology.

### 2. Carbon Sources Screening at Different Environmental Conditions  
Investigate how *E. coli* reallocates its metabolic resources when exposed to different carbon sources and oxygen levels using Flux Balance Analysis.

### 3. Robustness Analysis of E. coli Metabolic Model Under Variable Glucose and Oxygen Conditions  
Analyze the robustness of *E. coli*'s metabolic model under fluctuating glucose and oxygen levels.

### 4. E. coli Challenge: Metabolic Model Reconstruction and Analysis  
Use metabolic modeling techniques on anonymized *E. coli* strains to identify specific genomic characteristics. This challenge involves model reconstruction through the KBase cloud platform.

### 5. Engineering E. coli for Ethylene Production  
Design a simplified *E. coli* model to produce ethylene, exploring its application in fruit ripening control and waste reduction.
