## 4. E. coli Challenge: Metabolic Model Reconstruction and Analy
Overview: in this exercise, you will embark on a journey through the reconstruction and analysis of metabolic models for four distinct Escherichia coli strains.
The genomes of these strains have been anonymized, and your task is to use metabolic modeling techniques to identify which genome corresponds to the
BL21(DE3) strain and which corresponds to the K-12 substrain MG1655. In this challenge, you will rely on the KBase cloud platform for the metabolic
model draft reconstruction.

## 5. Engineering E. coli for Ethylene Production
Overview: This assignment focuses on an innovative synthetic biology application to enhance agricultural productivity and reduce post-harvest losses through ethylene production. Ethylene is a critical plant hormone involved in ripening fruits. By engineering a simplified model of Escherichia coli to produce ethylene, we aim to explore the potential of using genetically modified microorganisms to control the ripening process of fruits, ensuring optimal freshness and reducing waste.
